Bloglooks
=========

Bloglooks is a simple PHP blogging platform, built with the
[Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) and
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) stylesheets.
It is very lightweight and it's made for anyone looking for a non-bloated blogging system.
Bloglooks is backed by a SQL database (anything supported by Yii).
